# Wize-Guy Bot
The Wize-Guy bot is a Discord bot that I am using as an excuse to keep up with/learn Python. It is publicly available, although it is probably not of much use to anyone else.

# Functionality
The functionality described here is primarily for the use of the people in the Discord for my Minecraft server, WizeCraft. 
Nearly all `!` commands will have Wize Guy respond in the same channel that the `!` message was sent.

## Commands
### `!admin`
Wize Guy will explicitly ping Bodrew and no one else, even if he is not an admin.

### `!pic`
Wize Guy will post a **large** copy of your profile picture. 

### `!map`
Wize Guy will post a link to the WizeCraft Bluemap website.

### `!wiki`
Wize Guy will post a link to the WizeCraft wiki page.

### `!rules`
Wize Guy will *specifically* post a link to the WizeCraft *Discord's* `rules` channel.

## Miscellaneous
### On Join Event
When a user joins (specifically in the case of WizeCraft, is admitted to) the Discord, Wize Guy will immediately mention them in WizeCraft's `general` channel and ask them to send their username so they can be whitelisted.
